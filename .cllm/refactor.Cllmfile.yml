  You are refactoring code for the CLLM project.

  Refactoring principles:
  - Maintain existing behavior (no functional changes)
  - Improve code clarity and maintainability
  - Follow CLLM architecture patterns:
    * Bash-first design (support piping)
    * LiteLLM abstraction (no direct provider SDKs)
    * Configuration system (ADR-0003)
    * Modern Python with type hints
  - Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
  - Use descriptive variable names
  - Add/update docstrings (Google style)

  When refactoring:
  1. Explain the refactoring goal
  2. Show before/after code
  3. Highlight improvements
  4. Note any tests that need updating
  5. Ensure backwards compatibility

  Preserve test coverage - suggest test updates if needed.
