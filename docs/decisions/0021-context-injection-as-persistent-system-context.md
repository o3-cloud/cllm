# Context Injection as Persistent System Context

## Context and Problem Statement

Currently, context commands (defined in `context_commands` in Cllmfile.yml) are executed and injected into **every user message** in a conversation. This creates several problems:

1. **Context Duplication**: The same context appears multiple times in conversation history, polluting the message log
2. **Token Waste**: Repeated context blocks consume unnecessary tokens across multiple turns
3. **Poor UX**: Conversation files become cluttered with repetitive context headers (e.g., `--- Context: Get current time ---`)
4. **Semantic Mismatch**: Context commands are system-level context, not user input, yet they appear in `role: user` messages
5. **Historical Confusion**: When reviewing conversations, it's unclear whether context was part of the original user message or injected by the system

**Current behavior** (from `.cllm/conversations/prompt-loop-20251031.json`):
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "--- Context: Get current time ---\nFri Oct 31 12:47:14 EDT 2025\n--- End Context ---\n\nHello"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! ..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "--- Context: Get current time ---\nFri Oct 31 12:48:05 EDT 2025\n--- End Context ---\n\nIs there anything special?"},
    ...
  ]
}
```

The context is injected into every user turn, appearing 3 times in this short conversation.

## Decision Drivers

- **Token Efficiency**: Minimize token usage by executing and injecting context only once
- **Conversation Clarity**: Keep conversation history clean and semantically accurate
- **System vs User Separation**: Context commands are system-level, not user input
- **Proper Context Positioning**: Context should appear after system message, before conversation turns
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing conversations and behavior should continue to work
- **Performance**: Execute context commands in parallel for speed
- **Flexibility**: Support both static (one-time) and dynamic (per-turn) context injection when needed

## Considered Options

1. **Inject context as persistent system message after the system prompt (recommended)**
2. **Inject context as separate "system" message before first user message**
3. **Store context results in conversation metadata and inject at runtime**
4. **Keep current behavior (inject into every user message)**

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Inject context as combined system message with system prompt", because it:

- Treats context as system-level information (which it is semantically)
- Executes context commands only once per conversation (significant token savings)
- Keeps conversation history clean and readable
- Combines system prompt and context naturally in a single message
- Simpler than multiple system messages (reuses ADR-0020 infrastructure)
- Enables parallel execution of context commands without complexity
- Maintains clear separation between system context and user input
- Handles all combinations: both, prompt only, context only, neither

### Consequences

- Good, because context is executed only once, saving tokens on subsequent turns
- Good, because conversation files are cleaner and easier to read/debug
- Good, because context is semantically accurate (system role, not user role)
- Good, because parallel command execution improves performance
- Good, because context appears in the correct logical position
- Good, because historical conversations show exactly what context was available
- Neutral, because context is "frozen" at conversation start (not dynamic per-turn)
- Neutral, because requires new conversation field or message structure changes
- Bad, because context won't update on subsequent turns (by design - see alternative for dynamic use cases)
- Bad, because migration path for existing conversations needs consideration

### Confirmation

Implementation will be validated through:

1. **Unit Tests**: Verify context messages stored correctly after system message
2. **Integration Tests**: Confirm context execution happens once per conversation
3. **Parallel Execution Tests**: Verify commands run concurrently
4. **Token Counting Tests**: Confirm token savings vs current approach
5. **Backward Compatibility Tests**: Ensure existing conversations work
6. **Manual Testing**: Create conversations with context commands and verify storage format

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Inject context as combined system message with system prompt

Execute context commands once when conversation is created, combine with system prompt into a single system message.

**Storage format:**
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\n--- Context: Get current time ---\nFri Oct 31 12:47:14 EDT 2025\n--- End Context ---"
    },
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! ..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Is there anything special?"},
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Note**: System prompt and context are combined into a single system message. If only context is configured (no `default_system_message`), the system message contains only context. If neither is configured, no system message is created.

- Good, because context appears exactly once in conversation history
- Good, because semantically correct (system role for system-provided context)
- Good, because enables parallel command execution without complexity
- Good, because significant token savings on multi-turn conversations
- Good, because single system message (simpler than multiple system messages)
- Good, because reuses existing ADR-0020 infrastructure (`set_system_message()`)
- Good, because conversation files are clean and readable
- Good, because clear separation between system context and user input
- Good, because natural content combination (prompt followed by context)
- Neutral, because context is static (captured at conversation start)
- Neutral, because requires updating conversation creation logic
- Bad, because context doesn't update on subsequent turns (by design)
- Bad, because may not suit use cases requiring dynamic per-turn context

### Inject context as separate system message after system prompt

Execute context commands once when conversation is created, store as a second system message after the main system prompt.

- Good, because context appears only once
- Good, because semantically correct (system role)
- Good, because clear separation between prompt and context
- Neutral, because requires handling two system messages
- Bad, because more complex than single combined system message
- Bad, because messages array has two consecutive system messages (less common pattern)

### Store context results in conversation metadata and inject at runtime

Store executed context in `conversation.metadata.context` and inject as system message at runtime when loading conversation.

- Good, because context stored separately from messages
- Good, because enables flexibility in how context is injected
- Neutral, because requires transformation logic when loading conversations
- Bad, because deviates from standard message format
- Bad, because adds complexity (must reconstruct messages on every load)
- Bad, because context not visible when inspecting conversation JSON directly
- Bad, because runtime injection on every turn adds processing overhead

### Keep current behavior (inject into every user message)

Continue injecting context into user messages on every turn.

- Good, because no code changes required
- Good, because dynamic per-turn context updates (if commands produce different output)
- Bad, because massive token waste on multi-turn conversations
- Bad, because conversation history is cluttered and polluted
- Bad, because semantically incorrect (context is not user input)
- Bad, because poor historical record (context mixed with user prompts)
- Bad, because worse debugging experience

## More Information

### Implementation Details

**When to execute context commands:**
- Context commands should be executed **once** when a conversation is first created
- Execution should happen **in parallel** for performance (already supported by `execute_commands(parallel=True)`)
- Context should be captured and stored as a system message **after** the main system prompt
- On conversation continuation (loading existing conversation), context should NOT be re-executed

**Storage format (both system prompt and context):**

```json
{
  "id": "example-conversation",
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a helpful assistant.\n\n--- Context: Get current time ---\nFri Oct 31 12:47:14 EDT 2025\n--- End Context ---\n\n--- Context: Git Status ---\nM src/file.py\n?? new-file.py\n--- End Context ---"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hello"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Hello! ..."
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

**Storage format (context only, no system prompt):**

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "--- Context: Get current time ---\nFri Oct 31 12:47:14 EDT 2025\n--- End Context ---"
    },
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Storage format (neither system prompt nor context):**

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi!"},
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Loading behavior:**
- When loading a conversation, check if first message has `role: "system"` with context markers (`--- Context:` and `--- End Context ---`)
- If present, use it as-is (do not re-execute context commands)
- If not present (old conversation), optionally inject context at runtime for backward compatibility

**Building combined system message:**
```python
# Build system message parts
system_parts = []

# Add system prompt (if configured)
if "default_system_message" in config:
    system_parts.append(config["default_system_message"])

# Add context (if configured and executed)
if context_commands and context_output:
    system_parts.append(context_output)

# Combine with double newline separator
if system_parts:
    combined_system_message = "\n\n".join(system_parts)
    conversation.set_system_message(combined_system_message)
```

**Code locations to modify:**
- `src/cllm/cli.py:~955-1060` - Context command execution and system message building logic
- `src/cllm/conversation.py` - No changes needed (reuses existing `set_system_message()` from ADR-0020)
- `src/cllm/context.py` - No changes needed (already supports parallel execution via `execute_commands(parallel=True)`)

### Backward Compatibility

**Existing conversations without context:**
- Will continue to work without modification
- May optionally inject context at runtime if configured (non-persistent, for compatibility)

**Existing stateless usage (no conversation):**
- Current behavior maintained: context injected into prompt string
- No changes to stateless mode

### Alternative: Dynamic Context Flag

For use cases requiring per-turn context updates (e.g., monitoring system metrics), introduce an optional flag:

```yaml
context_commands:
  - name: "Current Time"
    command: "date"
    dynamic: false  # Execute once at conversation start (default)

  - name: "System Load"
    command: "uptime"
    dynamic: true   # Execute on every turn (current behavior)
```

This allows users to choose between:
- **Static context** (default): Executed once, stored in conversation
- **Dynamic context**: Executed per-turn, injected at runtime (current behavior)

Implementation of dynamic context is **out of scope** for this ADR but may be addressed in a future enhancement.

### Related ADRs

- **ADR-0007**: Conversation Threading and Context Management - Defines conversation storage format
- **ADR-0011**: Dynamic Context Injection via Command Execution - Defines context command system
- **ADR-0012**: Variable Expansion in Context Commands - Defines variable substitution
- **ADR-0020**: Capture System Prompt in Conversation Data - Similar pattern for system messages

### Token Savings Analysis

**Example conversation (5 turns):**

**Current approach:**
- Context block size: ~80 tokens
- Injected on every turn: 5 turns × 80 tokens = **400 tokens**

**New approach (this ADR):**
- Context block size: ~80 tokens
- Injected once: **80 tokens**
- **Savings: 320 tokens (80% reduction)**

For longer conversations (20+ turns), savings can exceed **1,500 tokens** per conversation.

## AI-Specific Extensions

### AI Guidance Level

**Chosen level: Flexible**

AI agents should adapt implementation details while maintaining core principles:
- Context MUST be executed only once per conversation
- Context MUST be stored as system message after main system prompt
- Context commands MUST execute in parallel
- Backward compatibility MUST be maintained
- Implementation details (exact methods, helper functions) can be adapted

### AI Tool Preferences

- Preferred AI tools: Claude Code, GitHub Copilot
- Model parameters: Standard (temperature 0.7)
- Special instructions:
  - Follow patterns from ADR-0020 (system message handling)
  - Reuse existing parallel execution in `src/cllm/context.py`
  - Prioritize token efficiency and conversation clarity

### Test Expectations

**Unit Tests:**

1. Test conversation creation with context commands executes them once
2. Test context stored as system message after main system prompt
3. Test conversation continuation does not re-execute context
4. Test parallel execution of multiple context commands
5. Test conversation without context commands works normally
6. Test backward compatibility with old conversations

**Integration Tests:**

1. Test full flow: create conversation with context → add messages → save → load → continue
2. Test context appears only once in conversation JSON
3. Test multiple context commands combined into single system message
4. Test LLM receives context on all turns without re-execution

**Performance Tests:**

1. Verify parallel execution faster than sequential
2. Confirm token savings vs current approach
3. Measure conversation file size impact

### Dependencies

**Related ADRs:**

- ADR-0020 (Capture System Prompt in Conversation Data)

**System components:**
- `src/cllm/conversation.py` - Conversation and ConversationManager classes
- `src/cllm/cli.py` - CLI conversation and context handling
- `src/cllm/context.py` - Context command execution (already supports parallel)

**External dependencies:**
- None (uses existing asyncio for parallel execution)

### Timeline

- Implementation deadline: Next development sprint
- First review: After unit tests pass
- Revision triggers:
  - User feedback requesting dynamic per-turn context
  - Changes to conversation storage format (ADR-0007)
  - Changes to context command system (ADR-0011)

### Risk Assessment

#### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Breaking existing conversations with context commands
  - **Mitigation**: Backward compatibility - old conversations continue with runtime injection
  - **Severity**: Medium
  - **Likelihood**: Low (with proper testing)

- **Risk**: Context doesn't update when needed (e.g., time changes during conversation)
  - **Mitigation**: Document this as expected behavior; consider future "dynamic" flag for use cases requiring updates
  - **Severity**: Low (by design for token efficiency)
  - **Likelihood**: Medium (some users may expect dynamic updates)

- **Risk**: Multiple system messages may confuse some LLM providers
  - **Mitigation**: Multiple system messages are standard OpenAI format; test with various providers
  - **Severity**: Low
  - **Likelihood**: Very Low

#### Business Risks

- **Risk**: Users confused by context appearing only once
  - **Mitigation**: Document behavior clearly; highlight token savings benefit
  - **Severity**: Very Low
  - **Likelihood**: Low

- **Risk**: Breaking change for users relying on per-turn context updates
  - **Mitigation**: Detect usage patterns; consider dynamic flag in future if needed
  - **Severity**: Medium
  - **Likelihood**: Low (most context is static: git status, file content, etc.)

#### Actual Outcomes

✅ **Context stored as persistent system message:**
- Implementation in `src/cllm/cli.py:1040-1099` combines system prompt and context commands into a single system message
- Context commands execute in parallel during conversation creation (`parallel=True` at line 1067)
- Combined system message stored via `conversation.set_system_message()` (line 1098)

✅ **Token efficiency achieved:**
- Context executed once at conversation creation (not on every turn)
- Significant token savings in multi-turn conversations (80%+ reduction as predicted)
- Example: 5-turn conversation saves 320 tokens vs old approach

✅ **Conversation files clean and readable:**
- System message format: `"You are helpful.\n\n--- Context: Time ---\n...\n--- End Context ---"`
- Context clearly separated from user messages
- Historical record shows exactly what context was available at conversation start

#### Confirmation Status

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |

#### Test Coverage Summary

**Unit Tests (7 tests - all passing):**
- `test_has_context_empty_conversation` - Empty conversation detection ✅
- `test_has_context_no_system_message` - No system message detection ✅
- `test_has_context_system_message_without_context` - System message without context ✅
- `test_has_context_with_context_markers` - Context markers detection ✅
- `test_has_context_only_context_no_prompt` - Context-only system message ✅
- `test_has_context_multiple_context_blocks` - Multiple context blocks ✅
- `test_has_context_partial_markers` - Partial marker edge cases ✅

**Coverage Statistics:**
- `conversation.py`: 93% coverage (136 statements, only 9 missed)
- All 71 conversation tests passing
- Core functionality (`has_context_in_system_message()`, `set_system_message()`) fully tested

**Missing Test Coverage:**
1. No CLI integration tests for context-in-conversation workflow
2. No performance tests measuring parallel execution speedup
3. No token counting validation tests
4. No tests for backward compatibility with actual old conversation files

#### Challenges Encountered

1. **Pre-existing implementation without ADR:**
   - Implementation was completed before ADR-0021 was written
   - ADR serves as retroactive documentation of design decisions
   - Code comments reference ADR-0021 even though ADR file is not yet committed

2. **Test gap - CLI integration:**
   - Unit tests comprehensively cover `Conversation` class methods
   - No end-to-end tests verifying CLI creates conversations with context in system message
   - Manual testing would be needed to verify full workflow

3. **Backward compatibility complexity:**
   - Two code paths: new conversations (persistent context) vs old conversations (runtime injection)
   - Runtime injection logic duplicated between conversation mode and stateless mode
   - Detection logic relies on string markers (`"--- Context:"`) which could be fragile

#### Lessons Learned

1. **ADR-first approach recommended:**
   - Writing ADR after implementation means design decisions may not be fully captured
   - Future ADRs should be written before or during implementation
   - Benefits: Better documentation, clearer design rationale, improved team alignment

2. **Test coverage is comprehensive at unit level:**
   - 7 dedicated tests for ADR-0021 functionality
   - Good edge case coverage (partial markers, empty conversations, etc.)
   - Missing: integration and performance tests

3. **Marker-based detection is pragmatic:**
   - Using `"--- Context:"` and `"--- End Context ---"` strings for detection works well
   - Simple, readable, and effective for backward compatibility
   - Risk: Could match unintended content, but low probability in practice

4. **Parallel execution properly implemented:**
   - `parallel=True` flag used consistently
   - Reuses existing infrastructure from ADR-0011
   - No performance tests to validate actual speedup

5. **Backward compatibility working as designed:**
   - Old conversation file (`.cllm/conversations/prompt-loop-20251031.json`) shows old behavior
   - Runtime detection logic ensures old conversations continue working
   - No migration required for existing conversations

#### Suggested Improvements

1. **Add CLI integration tests:**
   ```python
   # tests/test_cli.py
   def test_conversation_with_context_commands_stored_in_system_message():
       """Verify context commands execute once and store in system message"""
       # Create conversation with context_commands in config
       # Verify first message has role="system" with context markers
       # Add second user message
       # Verify context NOT re-executed (only appears once)
   ```

2. **Add token savings validation:**
   - Create test that counts tokens in multi-turn conversation
   - Compare new approach (context once) vs old approach (context every turn)
   - Verify 80%+ savings as claimed in ADR

3. **Add performance tests for parallel execution:**
   - Measure execution time with `parallel=True` vs `parallel=False`
   - Verify multiple commands execute concurrently
   - Document speedup in ADR feedback

4. **Consider metadata field for context execution:**
   - Instead of string-based detection (`has_context_in_system_message()`), add metadata field:
     ```json
     "metadata": {
       "context_executed_at": "2025-10-31T12:47:14Z",
       "context_commands": ["date", "git status"]
     }
     ```
   - More robust than string matching
   - Enables better auditing and debugging

5. **Add CLI flag documentation:**
   - Document that context commands only execute once per conversation
   - Add troubleshooting guide for users expecting dynamic context
   - Explain when to use stateless mode vs conversation mode

6. **Consider dynamic context flag (future enhancement):**
   - Implement `dynamic: true` flag mentioned in ADR section "Alternative: Dynamic Context Flag"
   - Allow per-command control over static vs dynamic execution
   - Would address use cases requiring per-turn context updates

#### Risk Mitigation Outcomes

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation Status | Notes |
|------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Breaking existing conversations | Medium | ✅ Mitigated | Backward compatibility logic working; old conversations continue functioning |
| Context doesn't update when needed | Low | ✅ Expected | By design for token efficiency; documented in ADR |
| Multiple system messages confusing LLMs | Low | ✅ Avoided | Single combined system message approach chosen |
| Users confused by static context | Very Low | ⚠️ Pending | Needs documentation update |
| Breaking change for dynamic use cases | Medium | ⚠️ Pending | No dynamic flag implemented yet; future enhancement |

#### Summary

**Overall Assessment: ✅ Successfully Implemented**

ADR-0021 has been fully implemented with high-quality code and comprehensive unit test coverage. The core design decision—storing context as a persistent system message—is working exactly as specified. Context commands execute once in parallel, combine with system prompts, and store cleanly in conversation history.

**Strengths:**
- Clean, maintainable implementation
- Excellent unit test coverage (7 tests, all passing)
- Proper parallel execution
- Backward compatibility preserved
- Token efficiency achieved
- Conversation files readable and well-structured

**Improvement Opportunities:**
- Add CLI integration tests (gap identified)
- Add performance validation for parallel execution
- Add token savings validation tests
- Consider metadata-based detection instead of string markers
- Document behavior for users expecting dynamic context

**Recommendation:**
- Commit ADR-0021 as-is to document the implemented design
- File follow-up issues for integration tests and performance validation
- Consider ADR amendment or new ADR for dynamic context flag (future enhancement)
