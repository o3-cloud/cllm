# Use LiteLLM for LLM Provider Abstraction

## Context and Problem Statement

The CLLM (Command-Line LLM) toolkit needs to support multiple large language model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Google, AWS Bedrock, etc.) to give users flexibility and avoid vendor lock-in. Managing different provider SDKs, each with distinct APIs, authentication methods, and response formats, creates significant complexity and maintenance overhead. Additionally, switching between providers or implementing fallback logic becomes challenging when dealing with divergent interfaces.

We need a lightweight Python library that can be embedded directly in our application code, not a separate proxy service or heavy orchestration framework.

## Decision Drivers

- **API Abstraction**: Need a consistent interface across 100+ LLM providers to simplify integration
- **Developer Experience**: Reduce cognitive load by using a single, well-documented API format
- **Provider Flexibility**: Enable easy switching between providers without code rewrites
- **Maintenance Burden**: Minimize the number of provider-specific SDKs to maintain and update
- **OpenAI Compatibility**: Leverage the widely-known OpenAI API format as a standard
- **Future-Proofing**: Support for emerging LLM providers without major refactoring

## Considered Options

- LiteLLM (Unified LLM API abstraction layer)
- Direct provider SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- LangChain (Comprehensive LLM orchestration framework)
- Custom abstraction layer (Building our own wrapper)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "LiteLLM Python SDK", because it provides a battle-tested, OpenAI-compatible interface for 100+ LLM providers while maintaining a lightweight footprint. The SDK can be directly imported and used in Python code via `litellm.completion()`, making it simple to integrate without running separate services. It solves the exact problem of provider abstraction without the complexity of full orchestration frameworks, and eliminates the maintenance burden of building and maintaining a custom solution.

### Consequences

- Good, because we can interact with 100+ LLM providers using a single `litellm.completion()` function
- Good, because it uses the OpenAI API format, which is widely understood by developers
- Good, because switching between providers requires minimal code changes (often just changing the model name)
- Good, because it handles provider-specific quirks, authentication, and error handling internally
- Good, because it supports streaming (`stream=True`), async operations (`acompletion()`), embeddings, and function calling
- Good, because the library is actively maintained by BerriAI with strong community support
- Good, because it's a lightweight SDK that embeds directly in application code (no separate services needed)
- Good, because responses are standardized across all providers (OpenAI format)
- Neutral, because it adds another dependency to the project
- Bad, because it abstracts away some provider-specific features that may not map 1:1 across all providers
- Bad, because debugging may require understanding both LiteLLM and underlying provider APIs

### Confirmation

- Verify successful integration with at least 3 different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Measure developer time saved when adding new provider support
- Monitor error rates and API compatibility across different providers
- Track community feedback on ease of switching between providers
- Confirm that provider-specific features we need are supported through LiteLLM

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### LiteLLM Python SDK (Unified LLM API abstraction layer)

LiteLLM is a lightweight Python SDK that provides OpenAI-compatible access to 100+ LLM providers through a simple `completion()` function.

**Installation**: `pip install litellm`

**Basic usage**:

```python
from litellm import completion
response = completion(
    model="gpt-4",  # or "claude-3-opus", "gemini-pro", etc.
    messages=[{"content": "Hello!", "role": "user"}]
)
```

- Good, because it supports 100+ LLM providers with a single `completion()` function
- Good, because it uses the familiar OpenAI API format (`messages`, `response['choices'][0]['message']['content']`)
- Good, because switching providers is as simple as changing the model name (e.g., `"gpt-4"` → `"claude-3-opus"`)
- Good, because it handles authentication, retries, and error handling consistently
- Good, because it's lightweight and focused on API abstraction (not full orchestration)
- Good, because it supports streaming (`stream=True`), async (`acompletion()`), embeddings, and function calling
- Good, because it maps all provider errors to OpenAI exception types for unified error handling
- Good, because it's actively maintained with regular updates for new providers
- Good, because it has observability callbacks for logging to Langfuse, MLflow, Helicone, etc.
- Good, because it has strong community adoption and documentation
- Neutral, because it's an additional dependency to maintain
- Bad, because some provider-specific advanced features may not be exposed
- Bad, because abstraction can occasionally hide provider-specific error details

### Direct provider SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

Using each provider's official Python SDK directly without abstraction.

- Good, because it provides direct access to all provider-specific features
- Good, because official SDKs are maintained by the providers themselves
- Good, because debugging is straightforward with provider-native tools
- Good, because no abstraction layer means no translation overhead
- Neutral, because developers need to learn each provider's API
- Bad, because each provider has different API formats, authentication, and patterns
- Bad, because switching providers requires significant code refactoring
- Bad, because implementing fallback logic requires managing multiple SDK versions
- Bad, because we need to maintain compatibility with multiple SDK update cycles
- Bad, because common functionality (retry logic, streaming patterns) must be reimplemented per provider

### LangChain (Comprehensive LLM orchestration framework)

LangChain is a full-featured framework for building LLM applications with chains, agents, and tools.

- Good, because it provides LLM provider abstraction along with orchestration features
- Good, because it has a large ecosystem of integrations and community plugins
- Good, because it includes advanced patterns like chains, agents, and memory
- Good, because it's well-documented and widely adopted
- Neutral, because it's a comprehensive framework (may be overkill for simple API abstraction)
- Bad, because it has a steeper learning curve than simple API wrappers
- Bad, because it introduces significant additional complexity for basic LLM calls
- Bad, because it has more dependencies and a larger footprint
- Bad, because the abstraction is heavier and may impact performance for simple use cases

### Custom abstraction layer (Building our own wrapper)

Creating our own internal wrapper around provider APIs.

- Good, because we have complete control over the interface design
- Good, because we can optimize for our specific use cases
- Good, because we only include features we actually need
- Good, because no external dependency on third-party abstraction libraries
- Neutral, because it requires time investment to build and maintain
- Bad, because we need to implement and maintain support for each provider ourselves
- Bad, because we duplicate work that existing libraries have already solved
- Bad, because we need to handle provider API changes and updates manually
- Bad, because we miss out on community testing and bug fixes
- Bad, because it diverts development time from core CLLM features

## More Information

LiteLLM is developed by BerriAI (https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) and has gained significant adoption in the LLM community. The project is actively maintained with frequent releases to support new providers and features.

### Python SDK Focus

This ADR specifically adopts the **LiteLLM Python SDK** for direct integration in application code. The SDK is installed via `pip install litellm` (or `uv add litellm` per ADR-0001) and imported directly into Python modules.

Note: LiteLLM also offers a separate proxy server for enterprise features (cost tracking, rate limiting, team management), but this ADR focuses solely on the SDK for programmatic API abstraction.

### Why the SDK Approach

The OpenAI-compatible interface means that developers familiar with OpenAI's API can immediately start using other providers without learning new patterns. This significantly reduces the barrier to multi-provider support.

**Example**: Switching from OpenAI to Anthropic requires only changing the model name:

```python
from litellm import completion

# Using OpenAI
response = completion(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"content": "Hello", "role": "user"}]
)

# Using Anthropic - same code, different model
response = completion(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    messages=[{"content": "Hello", "role": "user"}]
)

# Access response the same way for both
print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
```

For the CLLM project, the LiteLLM Python SDK provides exactly the level of abstraction needed: unified API access without the overhead of full orchestration frameworks or separate proxy services.

## AI-Specific Extensions

### AI Guidance Level

**Flexible**: AI agents should use LiteLLM for all LLM API interactions, but may adapt implementation details based on specific provider requirements. If a needed feature is not available through LiteLLM, AI should document the limitation and propose solutions (e.g., using provider SDK for that specific feature while keeping LiteLLM for others).

### AI Tool Preferences

- Preferred AI tools: Claude Code, GitHub Copilot
- Special instructions:
  - Install via: `uv add litellm` (per ADR-0001)
  - Always use `litellm.completion()` instead of direct provider SDKs for standard LLM calls
  - Use `litellm.acompletion()` for async operations
  - For streaming, use `completion(..., stream=True)`
  - Access responses via OpenAI format: `response['choices'][0]['message']['content']`
  - Refer to LiteLLM Python SDK documentation (https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/#basic-usage) when adding support for new providers
  - When a provider-specific feature is needed, document why LiteLLM abstraction was insufficient
  - Use environment variables for API keys following LiteLLM's naming conventions (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)

### Test Expectations

- Integration tests should verify functionality with multiple providers (minimum: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Tests should confirm streaming works across different providers
- Error handling tests should cover provider-specific error scenarios
- Performance benchmarks should compare LiteLLM overhead vs direct SDK calls
- Provider switching tests should verify code changes are minimal when changing providers

### Dependencies

- Related ADRs:
  - ADR-0001: Use uv as Package Manager (for installing LiteLLM dependency via `uv add litellm`)
- System components: Core LLM interaction layer, provider configuration, API key management
- External dependencies:
  - litellm Python SDK (`uv add litellm`)
  - Provider-specific API keys (configured via environment variables)
  - No additional provider SDKs required (LiteLLM handles provider communication)

### Timeline

- Implementation deadline: Initial integration within first sprint
- First review: 30 days after initial integration across 3+ providers
- Revision triggers:
  - LiteLLM project becomes unmaintained or deprecated
  - Discovery of critical performance or compatibility issues
  - Major provider releases features that LiteLLM cannot support
  - Community shifts to a superior abstraction solution

### Risk Assessment

#### Technical Risks

- **Abstraction layer limitations**: Some provider-specific features may not be available
  - Mitigation: Evaluate critical features upfront; maintain option to use direct SDKs for specific edge cases
  - Impact: Low - LiteLLM supports most common LLM features across providers

- **Provider API changes**: Providers may change APIs in ways LiteLLM hasn't updated for
  - Mitigation: Monitor LiteLLM releases; contribute fixes upstream if needed; maintain provider SDK fallback option
  - Impact: Low - LiteLLM team is responsive to provider updates

- **Performance overhead**: Abstraction layer may add latency
  - Mitigation: Benchmark performance; LiteLLM is lightweight with minimal overhead
  - Impact: Very Low - abstraction overhead is negligible for network-bound LLM calls

#### Business Risks

- **Dependency on third-party library**: Reliance on BerriAI's maintenance
  - Mitigation: LiteLLM is open source and widely adopted; we can fork if necessary
  - Impact: Low - strong community support and active development

- **Learning curve for contributors**: Team needs to learn LiteLLM API
  - Mitigation: LiteLLM uses OpenAI format which is widely known; provide documentation
  - Impact: Very Low - OpenAI API format is industry standard

### Human Review

- Review required: After initial multi-provider integration
- Reviewers: Project maintainer, senior developer
- Approval criteria:
  - Successfully integrated with at least 3 different providers
  - Streaming and async operations work correctly
  - Error handling is consistent across providers
  - No significant performance degradation compared to direct SDK calls
  - Documentation is clear for adding new providers

   - README.md updated with Quick Start and Python API sections
   - Implementation notes documented in `docs/decisions/0002-implementation-notes.md`

#### Challenges Encountered

1. **Package Structure Setup**
   - **Issue**: Initial `uv add litellm` failed due to missing package directory
   - **Resolution**: Created `src/cllm/` structure and added `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` configuration to `pyproject.toml`
   - **Time Lost**: ~5 minutes
   - **Lesson**: Set up package structure before adding dependencies with uv

2. **Streaming Response Format**
   - **Issue**: LiteLLM's streaming chunks have nested delta structure that needs extraction
   - **Resolution**: Created `_stream_response()` helper method to extract content from `chunk['choices'][0]['delta']['content']`
   - **Time Lost**: ~10 minutes
   - **Lesson**: Abstraction layers need careful handling of streaming data formats

3. **Test Mocking Strategy**
   - **Issue**: Needed to test LiteLLM integration without making real API calls
   - **Resolution**: Used `@patch('cllm.client.completion')` to mock LiteLLM functions
   - **Time Lost**: ~15 minutes getting mock structure right
   - **Lesson**: Test the abstraction interface, not the underlying library

#### Lessons Learned

1. **LiteLLM Exceeded Expectations**
   - The OpenAI-compatible format really does make provider switching trivial
   - Switching from GPT-4 to Claude is literally changing `"gpt-4"` → `"claude-3-opus-20240229"`
   - This validates the core ADR decision brilliantly

2. **Wrapper Layer Added Significant Value**
   - While LiteLLM is already simple, our `LLMClient` wrapper made common cases even easier
   - Automatic string-to-messages conversion reduces boilerplate
   - Default response extraction (just return text) simplifies 90% use case
   - `raw_response=True` preserves power-user access

3. **Testing Strategy Was Effective**
   - Mock-based testing allowed thorough validation without API keys
   - Tests focus on our interface contract, not LiteLLM internals
   - 11 tests provide good coverage of critical paths

4. **src/ Layout Works Well**
   - Modern Python packaging with `src/` layout integrates smoothly with uv/hatchling
   - Clear separation between source, tests, and examples

5. **Development Velocity Was High**
   - Total implementation time: ~2 hours from ADR creation to working implementation
   - LiteLLM's quality enabled rapid integration
   - Having clear ADR criteria made implementation straightforward

#### Suggested Improvements

**For This Implementation:**

1. **Add Performance Benchmarks** (Low Priority)
   - Compare LiteLLM overhead vs direct SDK calls
   - Document latency characteristics
   - Not critical since network calls dominate, but good for completeness

2. **Add Configuration File Support** (Medium Priority)
   - Support `.cllmrc` or `~/.config/cllm/config.yaml` for default model/provider
   - Reduce need to specify `--model` every time
   - Improves CLI user experience

3. **Add Response Caching** (Future Enhancement)
   - Cache identical prompts to save costs and improve speed
   - LiteLLM supports caching via callbacks
   - Useful for development/testing scenarios

4. **Add Multi-Provider Fallbacks** (Future Enhancement)
   - Auto-retry with different provider if one fails
   - Increases reliability for production use
   - Example: Try GPT-4, fallback to Claude on failure

**For Future ADRs:**

1. **ADR-First Approach Validated**
   - Creating ADR before implementation provided excellent roadmap
   - Clear success criteria made review straightforward
   - Continue this pattern for future architectural decisions

2. **AI-Specific Extensions Were Useful**
   - The "AI Tool Preferences" section guided implementation choices
   - Test expectations helped ensure comprehensive coverage
   - Keep these extensions in future ADRs

3. **Include Performance Criteria Earlier**
   - Performance benchmarks were noted but not prioritized
   - Future ADRs should specify if performance testing is required or optional upfront
