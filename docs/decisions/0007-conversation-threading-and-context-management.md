# Conversation Threading and Context Management

## Context and Problem Statement

CLLM currently operates as a stateless tool where each invocation is independent. Users cannot maintain context across multiple LLM interactions, which limits its usefulness for complex, multi-turn workflows such as iterative code reviews, exploratory conversations, or sequential task decomposition. A developer might want to ask follow-up questions, refine previous responses, or build on earlier context without manually copying and pasting previous outputs.

## Decision Drivers

- **Bash workflow compatibility**: Solution must work naturally with shell scripting and piping
- **Local-first architecture**: Align with existing design philosophy (no external services required)
- **Minimal user friction**: Simple CLI interface for starting/continuing conversations
- **Storage efficiency**: Avoid unbounded growth of conversation history
- **Privacy and security**: Keep conversation data local and user-controlled
- **Multi-provider support**: Work consistently across all LiteLLM providers
- **Token budget awareness**: Help users manage context window limits

## Considered Options

- **Option 1**: Local file-based conversation storage with JSON format
- **Option 2**: SQLite database for structured conversation management
- **Option 3**: Stateless with explicit context passing (manual user management)
- **Option 4**: Git-based conversation versioning
- **Option 5**: External API/service for conversation management

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "**Option 1: Local file-based conversation storage with JSON format**", because it provides the best balance of simplicity, bash-friendliness, and alignment with CLLM's local-first design philosophy. File-based storage is transparent, easily inspectable, and requires no additional dependencies.

### Consequences

- Good, because users can inspect/edit conversations with standard text tools (cat, jq, grep)
- Good, because it requires no external services or database dependencies
- Good, because files integrate naturally with version control systems
- Good, because implementation complexity is low (standard library file operations)
- Good, because users maintain full control over their conversation data
- Bad, because file-based storage may not scale efficiently for thousands of conversations
- Bad, because concurrent access to the same conversation requires locking mechanisms
- Neutral, because users need to manage conversation cleanup manually (though we can provide utilities)

### Implementation Details

**Conversation ID System:**

- **User-specified IDs**: Users can provide meaningful names (e.g., `code-review-auth`, `bug-investigation-123`)
  - Validation: alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores only
  - Example: `cllm "Review this code" --conversation code-review-auth-module`
- **Auto-generated IDs**: When no ID is specified, generate UUID-based IDs
  - Format: `conv-<8-char-hex>` (e.g., `conv-a3f9b2c1`)
  - Provides uniqueness without excessive length
- **ID conflict handling**: Check for existing conversations before creation

**CLI Behavior:**

- **Default (no flag)**: Stateless mode - no conversation created or stored (current behavior)
- **`--conversation <id>`**: Create new conversation with specified ID, or continue existing conversation
- **`--list-conversations`**: Display all stored conversations with metadata
- **`--delete-conversation <id>`**: Remove conversation from storage
- **`--show-conversation <id>`**: Display full conversation contents for debugging

**File Storage:**

- **Location precedence** (aligns with ADR-0003 Cllmfile precedence):
  1. `./.cllm/conversations/<id>.json` (local/project-specific, if `.cllm` directory exists)
  2. `~/.cllm/conversations/<id>.json` (global/home directory, fallback)
- **Format**: JSON with schema defined in Option 1 section
- **Atomic writes**: Write to temporary file, then rename to prevent corruption
- **File naming**: `<conversation-id>.json` (e.g., `code-review-auth.json` or `conv-a3f9b2c1.json`)
- **Rationale**: Local conversations are kept with the project, global conversations available everywhere

**Token Management:**

- Track total tokens per conversation in metadata
- Warn when approaching model context limits
- Future: Automatic summarization for long conversations

### Confirmation

Implementation will be validated through:

- **Unit tests**: Conversation creation, continuation, listing, and deletion
- **Integration tests**: Multi-turn conversations with actual LLM providers
- **Token counting accuracy**: Verify context window management works correctly
- **Bash workflow tests**: Verify piping and scripting scenarios work as expected
- **File format validation**: Ensure JSON structure is consistent and parseable
- **Performance benchmarks**: Verify file I/O doesn't add significant latency

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Local file-based conversation storage with JSON format

Store conversations as JSON files in `~/.cllm/conversations/` with a simple schema:

```json
{
  "id": "conv-a3f9b2c1",
  "created_at": "2025-10-27T10:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-10-27T10:45:00Z",
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "..." },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "..." }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "total_tokens": 1500,
    "tags": ["code-review"]
  }
}
```

- Good, because transparent and inspectable with standard Unix tools
- Good, because zero additional dependencies (uses Python stdlib)
- Good, because naturally fits bash workflows
- Good, because simple backup/restore (just copy files)
- Good, because easy to implement and test
- Neutral, because requires basic file locking for concurrent access
- Bad, because less efficient for complex queries (e.g., "find all conversations about X")
- Bad, because manual cleanup needed for old conversations

### Option 2: SQLite database for structured conversation management

Use SQLite database at `~/.cllm/conversations.db` with tables for conversations and messages.

- Good, because efficient querying and indexing capabilities
- Good, because built-in transaction support and ACID guarantees
- Good, because better scalability for many conversations
- Good, because SQLite is a single-file database (still local-first)
- Neutral, because requires SQL schema migrations for upgrades
- Bad, because less transparent than plain text files
- Bad, because harder to inspect/edit conversations manually
- Bad, because adds complexity to the implementation

### Option 3: Stateless with explicit context passing

Require users to manually manage context by piping previous outputs or using `--context-file` flag.

- Good, because no persistence layer needed
- Good, because maximum user control and transparency
- Good, because no storage management concerns
- Bad, because significant friction for multi-turn conversations
- Bad, because error-prone (users must manually track context)
- Bad, because doesn't solve the core problem

### Option 4: Git-based conversation versioning

Store conversations as markdown files and use git for versioning and history.

- Good, because full version control of conversations
- Good, because natural for developers
- Good, because enables branching/merging of conversation threads
- Neutral, because requires git repository initialization
- Bad, because heavy-weight for simple conversation storage
- Bad, because git overhead for every conversation turn
- Bad, because not all users want git integration

### Option 5: External API/service for conversation management

Use a cloud service or external API for conversation storage.

- Good, because enables multi-device sync
- Good, because offloads storage management
- Bad, because violates local-first principle
- Bad, because requires network connectivity
- Bad, because introduces privacy/security concerns
- Bad, because adds external dependencies

## More Information

This decision builds on the existing configuration system (ADR-0003) and should integrate naturally with the Cllmfile.yml workflow. Users should be able to configure default conversation behaviors (e.g., auto-save, token limits) in their configuration files.

Future enhancements could include:

- Conversation export/import functionality
- Automatic summarization of long conversations to manage token budgets
- Conversation search and filtering utilities
- Integration with RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) for long-term memory

## AI-Specific Extensions

### AI Guidance Level

#### Chosen level: Flexible

The core architecture (file-based storage, directory structure) should be followed strictly, but implementation details for token counting, file naming conventions, and utility functions can be adapted based on best practices and edge cases discovered during development.

### AI Tool Preferences

- **Preferred AI tools**: Claude Code for implementation
- **Model parameters**: Default CLLM settings (temperature: 0.7)
- **Special instructions**:
  - Ensure all file operations are atomic to prevent corruption
  - Use pathlib for cross-platform path handling
  - Follow existing code style in `src/cllm/`
  - Add comprehensive docstrings for all public APIs

### Test Expectations

- All conversation CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) have test coverage
- Test conversation continuation with message history
- Test token counting and context window management
- Test edge cases: empty conversations, malformed JSON, missing files
- Test concurrent access scenarios (if locking is implemented)
- Integration test: Multi-turn conversation with mock LLM responses
- CLI tests: Verify flags work correctly (`--conversation`, `--list-conversations`, `--delete-conversation`, `--show-conversation`)
- Minimum 90% code coverage for conversation management module

### Dependencies

- **Related ADRs**:
  - ADR-0002 (LiteLLM provider abstraction): Token counting must work across all providers
  - ADR-0003 (Cllmfile configuration): Conversation settings should be configurable
  - ADR-0005 (Structured output): May want to store structured outputs in conversations
- **System components**:
  - `src/cllm/client.py`: Extend LLMClient to accept conversation history
  - `src/cllm/cli.py`: Add conversation-related CLI flags
  - `src/cllm/conversation.py`: New module for conversation management
- **External dependencies**:
  - LiteLLM (existing): For token counting across providers
  - Python stdlib: `json`, `pathlib`, `datetime`, `uuid`
  - Optional: `tiktoken` for accurate OpenAI token counting

### Timeline

- **Implementation deadline**: 2 weeks from ADR approval
- **First review**: After core conversation storage implementation (week 1)
- **Revision triggers**:
  - User feedback indicating friction in conversation workflows
  - Performance issues with file-based storage (>1000 conversations)
  - Need for multi-device synchronization
  - Integration with RAG or vector databases

### Risk Assessment

#### Technical Risks

- **File corruption from concurrent access**: Implement file locking or atomic write operations (write to temp file, then rename)
- **Token counting inaccuracy**: Different providers use different tokenizers; use LiteLLM's token counting utilities and add safety margins
- **Context window overflow**: Implement token budget tracking and automatic conversation truncation/summarization
- **Cross-platform path issues**: Use `pathlib` consistently and test on Windows/Mac/Linux
- **Conversation storage growth**: Provide conversation cleanup utilities and document retention best practices

#### Business Risks

- **User privacy concerns**: Document clearly that conversations are stored locally; provide encryption options if needed
- **Migration complexity**: If we later need to switch to SQLite, provide migration tools
- **Feature creep**: Conversation management could become complex; maintain focus on core bash-centric use cases

### Human Review

- **Review required**: Before implementation and after core functionality is complete
- **Reviewers**: Project maintainer(s)
- **Approval criteria**:
  - All tests passing
  - Documentation updated (README, CLI help text)
  - Conversation file format documented
  - Example workflows provided
  - Performance acceptable (<100ms overhead for conversation loading)

- ✅ **Documentation complete**: README, CLAUDE.md, and ADR all updated with examples
- ✅ **Cross-platform support**: Uses `pathlib` consistently for Windows/Mac/Linux compatibility

**Challenges encountered**:

1. **Datetime deprecation warnings**: Initial implementation used `datetime.utcnow()` which is deprecated in Python 3.12
   - **Resolution**: Updated to `datetime.now(UTC)` with proper timezone handling
2. **Test fixture requirements**: Storage precedence testing required `monkeypatch` and `tmp_path` fixtures
   - **Resolution**: Added proper test fixtures to verify both local and global storage paths
3. **Exception chaining**: Linting flagged missing exception chains in error handling
   - **Resolution**: Added `from e` to exception raises for proper error traceability
4. **Storage location decision refinement**: Initially only used `~/.cllm/`, user feedback suggested local-first approach
   - **Resolution**: Implemented precedence system checking `./.cllm/` first, aligning with Cllmfile behavior

**Lessons learned**:

1. **Local-first storage is powerful**: Users appreciate project-specific conversations that stay with their projects while maintaining global conversation access
2. **Alignment with existing patterns**: Following ADR-0003's precedence model created consistency and met user expectations
3. **Comprehensive testing pays off**: 37 tests caught edge cases early (malformed JSON, duplicate IDs, storage precedence)
4. **Atomic writes are essential**: File corruption prevention through temp file + rename is critical for data integrity
5. **UUID truncation works well**: 8-character hex provides sufficient uniqueness while being human-readable
6. **Documentation examples drive adoption**: Concrete examples in README help users understand workflow patterns

**Suggested improvements**:

1. **Future: Conversation search**: Add `--search` flag to find conversations by content or metadata
2. **Future: Token budget warnings**: Implement proactive warnings when approaching context window limits
3. **Future: Conversation export/import**: Add commands for sharing or backing up conversations
4. **Future: Automatic summarization**: When conversations approach token limits, automatically summarize older messages
5. **Consider: Conversation tags**: Allow tagging conversations for better organization (`--tag bug`, `--tag review`)
6. **Consider: Conversation analytics**: Track usage patterns, most active conversations, token consumption trends

**Confirmation Status**:

✅ **Unit tests** - 37 conversation tests passing (Conversation dataclass + ConversationManager)
